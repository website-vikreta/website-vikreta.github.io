      SBP promotes green bitcoin mining. Companies have to register on their platforms through KYC based on that they will get benefits. They have their own coin cryptocurrency SBC(sustainable bitcoin certificate). The business has a requirement for reconstructing & redesigning its existing platform/web application.

      There are 3 essential modules i.e. Miner, Auditor, and Investor, which will mine the bitcoins, to verify the miners which is the third-party integration to the tool, and who purchases those bitcoins respectively.
      
      Website Vikreta has provided a completely updated UI/UX to the company. We did research on how to get the best possible design.
      
      We have provided all the required components, charts, graphs, and overall all the layout components which are necessary to enhance the functionality of the website. Also, a very easy-to-develop Figma design so that the tech team will be able to develop it easily & efficiently.

      Any blockchain-based project needs complete secure modules therefore, we have done all the required testing and made their web application look more professional and eclectic. It helps to gain users’ trust.

      This application will provide easy and instant information to the users about all the facilities given by SBP.

The website should be able to generate leads, gain traffic over time & should be modern yet optimized.

      `,
      description: `
      Our team invested a lot of time in creating the design & prototype. Just like regular projects we conducted a few rounds of requirement calls with the client to get clear with the requirements. Conducted surveys to get feedback on typography & colors. We did point to point analysis of the competitors so that nothing will be missed on the website. The content & the images are provided by the client. 

      The UI/UX of the website is neat & clean, but it’s super effective. After conducting the usability testing we found that 8/10 users scroll through the design for more than 2mins which is quite good. The attached Figma design has a complete overview, design & prototype of the project.
      
      This design is further developed using NextJS. NextJs has its own advantage over SEO, image optimization & cache. This boost the website's performance. Our aim was to create static pages for the website which need to be optimized as per the “google page speed index”, should have scrolling animations & should be responsive to all devices. We deliver the best possible result. Visit the website & see how we made this project successful.
      
      The main attraction of the project is the “design center” which you can see in Figma design. It’s an interactive 3D-based studio to get an exact idea of how your end product will look like. Another one is a multi-step “Get a free quote” form. It’s an add-on requirement put in by our team & this results in a really good outcome. The client likes it.
